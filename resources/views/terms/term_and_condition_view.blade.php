                <p>You acknowledge that we may be irreparably damaged if these Terms are not specifically enforced, and damages at law would be an inadequate remedy. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any provision of these Terms by you, we shall be entitled, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies that may be sought under Section 20, to an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach, without being required to show any actual damage or to post an injunction bond, and/or to a decree for specific performance of the provisions of these Terms. For purposes of this Section, you agree that any action or proceeding with regard to such injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Missouri. You consent to the jurisdiction of such court and waive any objection to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such court. You agree that service of any court paper may be effected on such party by mail or in such other manner as may be provided under applicable laws, rules of procedure or local rules.</p>

                <p>Most concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by contacting us as set forth in the &ldquo;Questions&rdquo; section below.<br />
                In the event that we are not able to resolve a dispute, and with the exception of the claims for injunctive relief by us as described above and otherwise set forth herein, you hereby agree that either you or we may require any dispute, claim, or cause of action (&ldquo;Claim&rdquo;) between you and us or any third parties arising out of use of the Site, the Services, and any other actions with us (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory) to be arbitrated on an individual (non-class) basis. However, both parties retain the right to seek relief in a small claims court (or a state court equivalent) for a Claim within the scope of its jurisdiction so long as the small claims action does not seek to certify a class, combine the claims of multiple persons, recover damages in excess of the limit for a small claim under applicable state law or is not transferred, removed, or appealed from small claims court to any different court. Additionally, if you are a California resident, you retain the right to obtain public injunctive relief from any court with proper jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS VERY LIMITED. ADDITIONALLY, ANY ARBITRATION OF A CLAIM WILL BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND, THEREFORE, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. AS PART OF THIS WAIVER, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WAIVE THE RIGHT TO ACT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN AN ARBITRATION; THAT EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, CLAIMS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST YOU MAY NOT BE JOINED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH CLAIMS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST ANY OTHER PERSON; AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT A CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARBITRATION OR MULTIPLE-PARTY ARBITRATION.</strong></p>

                <p><br />
                You and we agree that your use of the Services involves interstate commerce, and that this arbitration agreement shall be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) set forth in Title 9 of the U.S. Code to the fullest extent possible, notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, regardless of the origin or nature of the Claims at issue. The arbitrator must follow, to the extent applicable: (1) the substantive law of the state in which we entered into the transaction giving rise to this arbitration agreement; (2) the applicable statutes of limitations; and (3) claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator will not be bound by federal, state or local rules of procedure and evidence or by state or local laws concerning arbitration proceedings.<br />
                If either you or we elect to arbitrate a Claim, the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered under the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). Either you or we may elect to resolve a particular Claim through arbitration, even if the other party has already initiated litigation in court related to the Claim, by: (a) making written demand for arbitration upon the other party, (b) initiating arbitration against the other party, or (c) filing a motion to compel arbitration in court.<br />
                If this is a consumer-purpose transaction, the applicable rules will be the AAA&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules. The applicable AAA rules and other information about arbitrating a claim under AAA, including how to submit a dispute to arbitration, may be obtained by visiting its website at https://www.adr.org/ or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If AAA will not serve as the administrator of the arbitration, and you and we cannot then agree upon a substitute arbitrator, you and we shall request that a court with proper jurisdiction appoint an arbitrator. However, we will abide by the applicable AAA rules regardless of the forum. Arbitration shall be conducted in the county and state where you accepted these Terms, you reside, or another reasonably convenient place to you as determined by the arbitrator, unless applicable laws require another location. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Except as provided in applicable statutes, the arbitrator&rsquo;s award is not subject to review by the court and it cannot be appealed. The parties will have the option to request and receive a statement of reasons for the arbitration award.<br />
                If you elect to file the arbitration, and this is a consumer-purpose transaction, you will pay the filing fee to the extent required by AAA&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules but not to exceed the cost of filing a lawsuit. Any amount above what it would cost you to file a lawsuit, we will pay. All other arbitration fees and expenses shall be allocated to us according to AAA rules. Except for the arbitration fees and expenses, each party shall pay its own costs and fees incurred (including attorneys&rsquo; fees), unless the arbitrator allocates them differently in accordance with applicable law. This paragraph applies only if this is a consumer-purpose transaction.<br />
                Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, and except as otherwise set forth in this paragraph, the agreement to arbitration may be amended by us only upon advance notice to you. If we make any amendment to this agreement to arbitration (other than renumbering the agreement to align with any other amendment to the Terms) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding or action against us prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other Claims governed by this agreement to arbitration that have arisen or may arise between you and us. However, we may amend this agreement to arbitration and not provide you notice; in that case, the amendments will not apply to you and the agreement to arbitration contained in these Terms to which you agreed will continue to apply to you and us as if no amendments were made. &nbsp;<br />
                If any part of this arbitration provision is invalid, all other parts of it remain valid. However, if the class action limitation is invalid, then this arbitration provision is invalid in its entirety, provided that the remaining Terms shall remain in full force and effect. This arbitration provision will survive the termination of your use of the Site, the Services, and any other actions with us.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><br />
                <strong>You may reject this arbitration provision within thirty (30) days of accepting the Terms by emailing us at contact@umbrellamd.com and including in the subject line &ldquo;Rejection of Arbitration Provision.&rdquo;</strong></p>

                    <li><strong>Miscellaneous Provisions</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Severability. If any term or provision in these Terms is found to be void, against public policy, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction and such finding or order becomes final with all appeals exhausted, then the offending provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. If the offending provision cannot be so modified, then the same shall be deemed stricken from these Terms in its entirety and the remainder of these Terms shall survive with the said offending provision eliminated.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Governing Law and Venue.</em></strong>&nbsp;These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. Except as set forth in the agreement to arbitration and without waiving it, you agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms (including but not limited to if you opt out of the agreement to arbitration) shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts of St. Louis, Missouri, except where the jurisdiction and venue are mandated by applicable assignment.&nbsp;</p>
